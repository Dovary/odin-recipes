            <h3>Description:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This classic Italian dish from Sicily<br>
                It's often simply referred to as 'Parmigiana' by the Sicilian locals.<br>
                The richness and depth of flavor that you get from this authentic version is well worth the extra effort.<br>
                Serve eggplant Parmigiana with nothing more than crusty bread and a green salad.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>6 eggplant, trimmed and cut 1/2-inch thick slices</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>1 1/3 cups crushed tomatoes in puree</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
                <li>1  bunch fresh basil</li>
                <li>18 oz of mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>Dried oregano</li>
                <li>4 oz parmesan cheese</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat about 1 inch extra-virgin olive oil in a deep skillet over medium heat.<br>
                    Pat eggplant slices dry with a paper towel and fry eggplant in batches in the hot oil until golden,<br>
                    2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer eggplant to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon; <br>
                    season with salt.</li>
<br>
                <li>Combine tomato puree (passata), 1 tablespoon olive oil, garlic, salt, and 4 basil leaves in a saucepan; <br>
                    simmer over medium heat for 10 minutes. Remove garlic from sauce.</li>
<br>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish.</li>
<br>
                <li>Place a layer of fried eggplant in the baking dish and cover with a layer of tomato sauce. <br>
                    Top with a layer of mozzarella cheese, oregano, Parmesan cheese, and chopped basil leaves, in that order. <br>
                    Continue layering in the same order with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese and a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
<br>            
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheeses are melted, about 40 minutes. Let stand a few minutes before slicing.</li>
            
            </ol>
