            <h3>Description:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pillow-y, Fluffy, Creamy, Flavorful scramble eggs
                    </li>
                </ul>
        
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>4 large eggs</li>
                <li>1/4 cup half-n-half</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
                <li>black pepper, for serving</li>
                <li>fresh chopped herbs, for serving</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium mixing bowl, aggressively whisk together the eggs,<br>
                    half-n-half, and salt until the mixture is uniform in color and texture,<br> 
                    is light and foamy, without any separate streaks of yolk or whites.</li>
<br>
                <li>Melt the butter in a small nonstick pan over medium heat, <br>
                    until the butter coats the whole pan and just starts to foam.</li>
<br>
                <li>Add the eggs to the center of the pan and immediately reduce the heat to medium-low.</li>
<br>
                <li>Wait for the edges to just barely start to set, then using a rubber spatula, <br>
                    gently push the eggs from one end of the pan to the other. Continue this process, <br>
                    pausing in between swipes to allow the uncooked egg to settle on the warm pan and cook, <br>
                    gently pushing the liquid to form the curds. </li>
<br>            
                <li>When the eggs are mostly cooked, with big pillow-y folds, but still look pretty wet, <br>
                    slowly fold the eggs into itself just a couple times, bringing them together.</li>
<br>             
                <li>Remove from the heat when the eggs still shimmer with some moisture.</li>
<br>
                <li>Transfer to serving plates. Finish with some freshly cracked pepper and chopped fresh herbs. <br>
                    Scrambled eggs have never tasted so good! </li>
            </ol>
